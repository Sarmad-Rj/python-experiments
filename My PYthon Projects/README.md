🐍 Mini Project Collection: Python CLI CRUD Practice 🐍
Welcome to my collection of Python CLI mini-projects built for practical CRUD practice, portfolio strengthening, and consistent skill improvement.

This collection includes:

1️⃣ CGPA Calculator (CLI) 
2️⃣ YouTube Video Manager (JSON-based)
3️⃣ Password Manager (SQLite-based)
4️⃣ Contact Book (MongoDB Atlas)

🚀 Project Overviews

1️⃣ CGPA Calculator (CLI)
🔹 Calculates your CGPA based on GPA of each semester.
🔹 Takes user input cleanly with validation structure.
🔹 Uses Python classes and modular structure.
🔹 Great for beginners to understand class encapsulation and loops.

> Tech: Python CLI

2️⃣ YouTube Video Manager (JSON)
🔹 A CLI tool to add, view, update, and delete YouTube video details (name, duration).
🔹 Uses JSON file for local persistence (simple structured data storage).
🔹 Uses Python’s `match-case` (Python 3.10+) for clear CLI handling.
🔹 Helps learn basic file handling, CRUD, and structured CLI building.

> Tech: Python CLI, JSON

3️⃣ Password Manager (SQLite)
🔹 CLI-based password manager to generate, store, view, update, and delete passwords securely in SQLite database.
🔹 Generates random passwords from a custom character set.
🔹 Uses SQLite for structured local storage, letting you practice table creation, insertion, updating, and deletion.
🔹 Note: Passwords are stored in plain text for learning only (encryption will be added in advanced versions).

> Tech: Python CLI, SQLite

4️⃣ Contact Book (MongoDB Atlas)
🔹 A CLI contact management system that stores contact name, phone, email, and address in MongoD Atlas (cloud database).
🔹 Lets you add, view, update, and delete contacts with clean CLI interactions.
🔹 Uses Pymongo for database connectivity and operations.
🔹 A beginner-friendly introduction to cloud database operations, CRUD, and MongoDB Atlas deployment.
